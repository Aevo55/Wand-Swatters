There's actually some new changes but I can't figure out my git credentials so the code lives on my comptuer now

Collision is actually fixed in this version, it SHOULD just be impossible to clip through walls at all now.

Graphics rework in progress! Raycasting exists currently but I can't figure out how to remove the fisheye effect. 2D graphics are getting reworked to seperate grpahics from hitboxes, allowing .png graphics and an easier way to do decorations.
